# Node-style stream for getUserMedia

[![npm-version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/microphone-stream.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/microphone-stream)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/microphone-stream/microphone-stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/microphone-stream/microphone-stream)

If you just want to get some audio data from your microphone, this is what you're looking for!

Converts a [MediaStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) (from [getUserMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getUserMedia)) into a standard Node.js-style stream for easy `pipe()`ing.

Note: This only works in a [limited set of browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=getusermedia)
(typically with [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) or [browserify](http://browserify.org/)),
and then only for [https or localhost in Chrome](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/prefer-secure-origins-for-powerful-new-features).
It does not work in Node.js.

### Example

```js
const getUserMedia = require('get-user-media-promise');
const MicrophoneStream = require('microphone-stream');

document.getElementById('my-start-button').onclick = function() {

  // note: for iOS Safari, the constructor must be called in response to a tap, or else the AudioContext will remain
  // suspended and will not provide any audio data.
  const micStream = new MicrophoneStream();

  getUserMedia({ video: false, audio: true })
    .then(function(stream) {
      micStream.setStream(stream);
    }).catch(function(error) {
      console.log(error);
    });

  // get Buffers (Essentially a Uint8Array DataView of the same Float32 values)
  micStream.on('data', function(chunk) {
    // Optionally convert the Buffer back into a Float32Array
    // (This actually just creates a new DataView - the underlying audio data is not copied or modified.)
    const raw = MicrophoneStream.toRaw(chunk)
    //...

    // note: if you set options.objectMode=true, the `data` event will output AudioBuffers instead of Buffers
   });

  // or pipe it to another stream
  micStream.pipe(/*...*/);

  // Access the internal audioInput for connecting to another nodes
  micStream.audioInput.connect(/*...*/));

  // It also emits a format event with various details (frequency, channels, etc)
  micStream.on('format', function(format) {
    console.log(format);
  });

  // Stop when ready
  document.getElementById('my-stop-button').onclick = function() {
    micStream.stop();
  };
 }


```

## `API`

### `new MicrophoneStream(opts)` -> [Readable Stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html)

Where `opts` is an option object, with defaults:

```js
{
  stream: null,
  objectMode: false,
  bufferSize: null,
  context: null
}
```

- **stream**: [MediaStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) instance. For iOS compatibility, it is recommended that you create the MicrophoneStream instance in response to the tap - before you have a MediaStream, and then later call setStream() with the MediaStream.

- **bufferSize**: Possible values: null, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384. From [Mozilla's Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext/createScriptProcessor):
  > It is recommended for authors to not specify this buffer size and allow the implementation to pick a good buffer size
  > to balance between latency and audio quality.
- **objectMode**: if true, stream enters [objectMode] and emits AudioBuffers instead of Buffers. This has implications for `pipe()`'ing to other streams.

- **context** is the AudioContext instance. If omitted, one will be created automatically.

#### `.setStream(mediaStream)`

Set the mediaStream, necessary for iOS 11 support where the underlying AudioContext must be resumed in response to a user tap, but the mediaStream won't be available until later.
Note: Some versions of Firefox leave the recording icon in place after recording has stopped.

#### `.stop()`

Stops the recording.
Note: Some versions of Firefox leave the recording icon in place after recording has stopped.

#### `.pauseRecording()`

Temporarily stop emitting new data. Audio data recieved from the microphone after this will be dropped.

Note: the underlying Stream interface has a [`.pause()` API](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_pause) that causes new data to be buffered rather than dropped.

#### `.playRecording()`

Resume emitting new audio data after `pauseRecording()` was called.

#### Event: `data`

Emits either a [Buffer] with raw 32-bit Floating point audio data, or if [objectMode] is set, an [AudioBuffer] containing the data + some metadata.

#### Event: `format`

One-time event with details of the audio format. Example:

```js
{
  channels: 1,
  bitDepth: 32,
  sampleRate: 48000,
  signed: true,
  float: true
}
```

## `MicrophoneStream.toRaw(Buffer) -> Float32Array`

Converts a `Buffer` (from a `data` event or from calling `.read()`) back to the original Float32Array DataView format. (The underlying audio data is not copied or modified.)
